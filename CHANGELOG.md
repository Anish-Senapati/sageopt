# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
 - Added important functions to sageopt's ``__init__.py`` file.
 For example, you can now call ``sageopt.standard_sig_monomials(n)`` and
 ``sageopt.constrained_sage_primal(....)`` without following a chain of
 subpackages.
 - The naming conventions for functions relating to polynomials, versus
 functions relating to signomials is not consistent. Before writing more
 documentation (and releasing version 0.2.1) I should make these consistent.


## [0.2.0] - 2019-05-24
### Added
 - This changelog.md file.
 - A README file.
 - License information.
### Remarks
 - Bumping version from 0.1 to 0.2, because I've made a ton of changes to 0.1 without noting them in a changelog.
   This is effectively me starting from scratch with version numbers, in preparation for a public release.
